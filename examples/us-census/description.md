The [2020 Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-main.html) counted every person living in the United States and the five U.S. territories. It marked the 24th census in U.S. history and the first time that households were invited to respond to the census online.

The tables included on the Planetary Computer include information population counts at various geographic boundaries.
